# Python-Pandas--homework

Description of the homework.

The assignment is to enable the determination the performance of the best performing portfolio across multiple areas such as volatility, risk, return and sharpe Ratio

After importing the relevant Libraries for the challenge, the cvs file that contains the return data for the various investment (Whales, Algo 1&2, S&P TSX60) was read and cleaned by removing all nulls.

Various qualitative analysis such as performance analysis(to determine return), Risk Analysis(to determine Standard Deviation), Rolling Statistics (to determine  correlation and beta) as well as Sharpe ratio were generated. 

The outcome showed that Algo 1 outperformed both S&P TSX 60 and whales portfolios. However, Alog 2 outperformed S&P TSX 60 as well as two of the whales portfolios i.e Paulson & co and Tiger Global Mgt.

A custom portfolio comprising of Amazon, Apple and Canada Air was built and same analysis above was performed on the portfolio. 

Upon comparing the newly built portfolio with the previous one, I came to the conclusion that my portfolio outperformed Whales, Algo 1& 2 as well as S&P TSX 60. This means that investors in my portfolio are compensated for the risk compared to holders of other investments during the period.
